Icing:
    - UI Overhaul (including Global Nav Bar and modernization)
    - Built-in Simplified quickbooks
    - Stronger HIPPA Compliant Security
    - Audit log
    - bulk add receiving cultures
    - historic results

Future Implementations:
    - Verification on SampleID length
    - More concise input validation

Needs Fixing
    - 2 of the same exact techs can be created. If either is deactivated it will login as the other one (Possible fix - query to see if user name exists upon creation of new tech, if it does say "username taken", otherwise allow)
    - DUWL Result when editing the clinician and saving, it doesn't update to new clinician until you remove and search and save again

TODO:
    Threading for print processes?

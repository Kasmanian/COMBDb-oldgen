Icing:
    - UI Overhaul (including Global Nav Bar and modernization) (WIP)
    - Built-in Simplified quickbooks
    - Stronger HIPPA Compliant Security
    - Audit log
    - bulk add receiving cultures
    - historic results
    - confirmation windows when updating existing orders

Future Implementations:
    - Verification on SampleID length (done)
    - More concise input validation (WIP)

Needs Fixing
    - 2 of the same exact techs can be created. If either is deactivated it will login as the other one (Possible fix - query to see if user name exists upon creation of new tech, if it does say "username taken", otherwise allow)
    - DUWL Result when editing the clinician and saving, it doesn't update to new clinician until you remove and search and save again
    - Redo DUWL Result Template - Clinician info that prints in the top left corner relies heavily on proper input from the techs, maybe delete the designation line
    - DUWL Result must only allow orders from the same clinician to be added at a time or it will only print the latest clinician on the template

    - write class that queries all prefixes and formats data to be more usable

TODO:

Actions that should be tracked in audit log:

login
create new order
search order
edit existing order
create new clinician
edit clinician
create new tech
edit tech
print order
view rejection log
print rejection log
view qa report
print qa report
add prefix
edit prefix
change database paths

Instead of rewriting the add functions for all classes, just call the search function of the class and pass in the results that were queried
